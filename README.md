# CNN-Based-Video-Stabilization
Your goal is to build an AI model that takes in shaky aerial video (like what you’d get from a handheld drone or camera) and outputs a smooth, stabilized version — similar to what a physical gimbal does. But here’s the twist — you’ll be doing it entirely through deep learning, without using any hardware stabilizer.
